## üìà **Results Table **
## üìä Descriptive Statistical Analysis

### ‚úÖ Central Tendency Measures (Hospital Cost)
| Metric       | Value (‚Çµ) |
|--------------|-----------|
| **Mean**     | 8,367.48  |
| **Median**   | 6,000.00  |
| **Mode**     | 3,000.00  |

**Insight:**  
- The **mean cost** (‚Çµ8,367.48) is **higher than the median** (‚Çµ6,000), suggesting a **right-skewed distribution** where some high-cost patients are pulling the average up.
- The **mode** is ‚Çµ3,000, indicating that the most frequent hospital cost is relatively low compared to the average.

---

### ‚úÖ Spread & Variability (Hospital Cost)
| Metric                | Value (‚Çµ) |
|-----------------------|-----------|
| **Variance**          | 60,248,503.92 |
| **Standard Deviation**| 7,761.99  |

**Insight:**  
- The **standard deviation** is quite large, meaning hospital costs vary significantly from patient to patient.
- A high variance indicates a wide range of hospital bills, confirming the skewed nature of the data.

---

### ‚úÖ Percentile Distribution
| Percentile | Cost (‚Çµ) |
|------------|----------|
| **10th**   | 500      |
| **30th**   | 2,000    |
| **50th** *(Median)* | 6,000 |
| **70th**   | 12,000   |
| **90th**   | 20,000   |

**Insight:**  
- **50% of patients** pay **‚Çµ6,000 or less** for hospital care.
- However, **10% of patients** pay **‚Çµ20,000 or more**, highlighting a significant difference between typical and high-end costs.
- This reinforces the **right-skewed distribution** observed earlier.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway:
> The hospital cost dataset is highly skewed, with extremely high-cost cases driving up the mean.  
The majority of patients pay modest amounts, but a small group incurs very high expenses, indicating potential outliers or critical cases needing special attention.

---

‚úÖ Summary:
Overall, the dataset exhibits high variability and right-skewness, meaning that while most patients incur moderate costs, a few high-cost cases significantly affect the overall average. These insights were critical in guiding model selection and evaluation for the cost prediction task.

## üìà Linear Regression Evaluation (Cost vs Length of Stay)

| Metric          | Value      |
|-----------------|------------|
| **R¬≤ Score**    | 0.013      |
| **MAE**         | ‚Çµ6,545.85  |
| **MSE**         | 58,027,386.04 |
| **RMSE**        | ‚Çµ7,617.57  |
| **Intercept**   | ‚Çµ6,954.86  |
| **Slope**       | 41.81      |

### ‚úÖ Interpretation:
- The **R¬≤ score** of 0.013 indicates that the model explains only about **1.3%** of the variance in hospital costs based on Length of Stay alone. This suggests a **weak linear relationship** between the two variables.
- The **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of ‚Çµ6,545.85 means that on average, the model's predictions deviate from the actual costs by about ‚Çµ6,546.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** is also quite high, showing that prediction errors can be significant in magnitude.
- The **positive slope (41.81)** indicates that as Length of Stay increases by one unit, the hospital cost tends to increase by around ‚Çµ41.81, but the effect size is relatively small.

### ‚úÖ Key Insight:
Although longer hospital stays tend to increase costs, the relationship here is **weak and possibly non-linear or influenced by other factors** (e.g., treatment type, severity, insurance coverage). This finding justifies trying **more complex models** (such as Polynomial Regression or Multiple Regression).

---

## üîó Correlation Analysis (Length of Stay vs Cost)
- **Correlation Coefficient (r):** **0.1142**

### ‚úÖ Insight:
There is a **weak positive correlation** between Length of Stay and Hospital Cost.  
This suggests that while longer stays generally increase costs, the relationship is **not strong**, implying that **other variables** (like type of treatment or patient condition) may also be significant contributors to cost.

---

## üìà Polynomial Regression (Degree 3) Evaluation

| Metric          | Value     |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **R¬≤ Score**    | 0.032     |
| **MAE**         | ‚Çµ6,430.64 |
| **MSE**         | 56,965,152.10 |
| **RMSE**        | ‚Çµ7,547.53 |
| **Intercept**   | ‚Çµ2,706.43 |
| **Coefficients**| [0, 653.23, -20.67, 0.19] |

### ‚úÖ Interpretation:
- The **R¬≤ score** of **0.032** shows a slight improvement over the simple linear regression, explaining about **3.2%** of the cost variance.
- The **MAE** and **RMSE** are slightly lower than those from the linear model, indicating marginally better predictive accuracy.
- The coefficients suggest a **non-linear relationship** between Length of Stay and Cost:
  - The linear term has a large positive coefficient (‚Çµ653.23).
  - The negative quadratic term (-20.67) and positive cubic term (0.19) show that the relationship bends as the Length of Stay increases.

### ‚úÖ Key Insight:
While polynomial regression (degree 3) slightly improves predictions over simple linear regression, the overall explanatory power remains weak. This suggests that **Length of Stay alone is insufficient to accurately predict hospital costs**, and additional features should be explored.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature Scaling
I applied **standardization** on the `Length_of_Stay` feature using **StandardScaler** to normalize its scale:

| Sample Scaled Values (Length of Stay) |
|--------------------------------------|
| -1.67, -1.77, -1.87, -1.57, -1.41 |

### ‚úÖ Insight:
- The scaled values now have a **mean of 0** and **unit variance**.
- Feature scaling is essential before applying certain algorithms or combining features with different scales in regression models.
- Though scaling doesn‚Äôt affect the performance of **Linear Regression**, it ensures consistency, especially when extending models later.

## üìä Multiple Linear Regression (with Age, Length of Stay, Satisfaction)

| Metric          | Value     |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **R¬≤ Score**    | 0.235     |
| **MAE**         | ‚Çµ5,514.30 |
| **MSE**         | 45,014,485.66 |
| **RMSE**        | ‚Çµ6,709.28 |
| **Intercept**   | ‚Çµ27,543.76 |
| **Coefficients**| {'Age': -42.83, 'Length_of_Stay': 564.10, 'Satisfaction': -4,637.46} |

### ‚úÖ Interpretation:
- **R¬≤ Score** of **0.235** shows a clear improvement over both linear and polynomial models ‚Äî about **23.5%** of the variance in hospital costs is explained by this model.
- **MAE** and **RMSE** are also lower than previous models, indicating improved prediction accuracy.
- **Coefficients Interpretation:**
  - **Age:** A very slight negative impact on cost (-‚Çµ42.83 per year); not highly impactful here.
  - **Length of Stay:** Strong positive impact; each additional day in hospital adds about **‚Çµ564.10** to the predicted cost.
  - **Satisfaction:** Strong negative impact; higher satisfaction correlates with **lower hospital costs** (‚Çµ4,637.46 decrease per satisfaction unit ‚Äî possibly indicating healthier, faster recoveries or lower resource use among satisfied patients).

### ‚úÖ Key Insight:
This model performs significantly better, indicating that **hospital costs depend on multiple factors** rather than just Length of Stay alone. It highlights the importance of incorporating **multiple features** in predictive models for more realistic results.

## üìä Model Comparison Summary

| Model             | R¬≤ Score | MAE          | RMSE        |
|------------------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Linear**       | 0.013    | ‚Çµ6,545.85    | ‚Çµ7,617.57   |
| **Polynomial (3)**| 0.032    | ‚Çµ6,430.64    | ‚Çµ7,547.53   |
| **Multiple**     | 0.235    | ‚Çµ5,514.30    | ‚Çµ6,709.28   |

---

### ‚úÖ Insight:
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Very low predictive power (**R¬≤ = 0.013**) with high prediction errors (MAE & RMSE).
   - Indicates that **Length of Stay alone** is not sufficient to predict hospital cost effectively.

2. **Polynomial Regression (Degree 3)**:
   - Slightly better than linear regression (**R¬≤ = 0.032**) with small improvements in MAE and RMSE.
   - Captures minor non-linear patterns, but is still poor at explaining the variance.

3. **Multiple Regression**:
   - **Best-performing model** among the three with **R¬≤ = 0.235**, explaining about **23.5%** of the variance in hospital costs.
   - Shows lower errors, confirming that **multiple features** (Age, Length of Stay, Satisfaction) improve predictions.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaway:
> The analysis shows that **including multiple variables** provides significantly better cost predictions than models based on a single feature like Length of Stay.  
However, even the best model explains only around **23.5%** of the cost variance, suggesting that additional factors may be influencing hospital costs (e.g., diagnosis type, insurance, treatments).
